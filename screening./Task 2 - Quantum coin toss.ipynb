Task 2 - Quantum coin toss¶
Implement a circuit that returns |01> and |10> with equal probability. (WORK IN PROGRESS)

Requirements:

The circuit should consist only of CNOTs, RXs and RYs.
Start from all parameters in parametric gates being equal to 0 or randomly chosen.
You should find the right set of parameters using gradient descent (you can use more advanced optimization methods if you like).
Simulations must be done with sampling (i.e. a limited number of measurements per iteration) and noise.
Compare the results for different numbers of measurements: 1, 10, 100, 1000.

Bonus question:
How to make sure you produce state |01> + |10> and not |01> - |10> ?

(Actually for more careful readers, the “correct” version of this question is posted below: How to make sure you produce state |01⟩ + |10⟩ and not any other combination of |01> + $e^{i\phi}$|10⟩ (for example |01⟩ - |10⟩)?)

Solution
It suffices to produce the state |01> + |10> and measure it in the computational basis. This can be achieved by the following circuit.

In [1]:
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, execute, Aer
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram

bell = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)
bell.h(0)
bell.cnot(0, 1)
bell.x(1)
bell.measure([0, 1], [0, 1])
bell.draw()

Let's verify that this circuit does what we expect.

In [2]:
result = execute(bell, Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')).result()
counts = result.get_counts(0)
plot_histogram(counts)

To make the simulation more realistic, we will add some noise to the quantum gates, based on the IBM Q Vigo, a 5-qubit device.

                 coupling_map=coupling_map,
                 basis_gates=basis_gates,

Unfortunately, this solution uses the Hadamard and Pauli-X gates, which are not allowed. We are asked to use only the RX, RY, and CNOT gates, and to use gradient descent or another optimization method to estimate the parameters. Let us try to build the simplest circuit that could plausibly produce the Bell state. We must have at least one 2-qubit gate because the Bell state is entangled. On the other hand, the Bell state cannot be generated by CNOT gates alone, because CNOTs permute the computational basis but the Bell state is not in the computational basis. Our candidate circuit will apply an RX gate to each qubit, followed by a CNOT gate.

The last parameter vector that we found is suspiciously close to $(\pi/2, \pi)$. If we use these parameters, do we get the Bell state? Let's find out!

In [30]:
circuit = bell2.assign_parameters(dict(zip(params, [np.pi/2, np.pi])))
circuit.remove_final_measurements()
result = execute(circuit, Aer.get_backend('statevector_simulator')).result()
statevector = result.get_statevector()
print(statevector.round(decimals=8))
[ 0.        +0.j         -0.70710678-0.j          0.        -0.70710678j
  0.        -0.j        ]
Yes! This is the state |01> + |10>.
